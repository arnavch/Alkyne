# Alkyne Android App

## Overview
To deepen my grasp on Data Structures and Algorithms, I crafted an Android application titled **Alkyne** using the Flutter framework. 

## Functionality
Alkyne is designed to focus on chemical conversions. It presents users with a series of reactions to transform a given organic compound into a desired one.

## Algorithm Implementation
Internally, the app leverages the Dijkstra algorithm to ascertain the most efficient reaction pathways, ensuring users get the best sequence for their conversions.
